The Personal assistant informally called "chellam" can help students with daily work

can search google for queries,
take down notes,
search for content in pdfs, using Embeddings from Language Models to look for context in keywords.

future idea:
adding connectivity ot google calendar and making the pdf search better and adding more files extentions to the search feature.
